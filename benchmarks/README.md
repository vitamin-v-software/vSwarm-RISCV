# Benchmark summary

vSwarm currently supports two kinds of microbenchmarks. One is the **multi-function benchmark**, which involves synchronous and asynchronous function composition. The other is **standalone function benchmark** where each function is a single function and not a composition of multiple functions (i.e. no producer-consumer functions).

## Patterns

- **Pipeline** - Describes a 1-to-1 workflow from one function to another, such that a chain of
functions are used to execute the benchmark.
- **Broadcast** - Describes a pattern whereby one function sends the same payload to multiple
recipient functions and awaits their individual replies, similar to publisher-subscriber design
pattern. A common example can be seen in distributed ML training where the same training model is
passed to multiple consumers.
- **Scatter** - Describes a fan-out one-to-many pattern whereby one function sends payloads to
multiple recipients. Unlike the broadcast pattern, the sent payloads are different from each other.
- **Gather** - Describes a fan-in many-to-one pattern, whereby a consumer retrieves objects from
multiple producers, e.g., as in the reduce phase in MapReduce.
